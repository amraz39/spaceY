# spaceY
## Introduction
In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceY will reuse the first stage.

## Projeects
### Complete and Preprocess the Data Collection API
<code>[jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb]</code>

Make a get request to the SpaceX API. You will also do some basic data wrangling and formating.
* Request to the SpaceX API
* Clean the requested data

### Data Collection with Web Scraping
<code>[jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb]</code>

Perform web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches

### Data Wrangling
<code>[labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb]</code>

Perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

### EDA with SQL
<code>[jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb]</code>

Determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

### EDA with Visualization Using Pandas and Matplotlib
<code>[edadataviz.ipynb]</code>

Determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

### Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium lab
<code>[lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb]</code>

Perform more interactive visual analytics using Folium

### Build an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash
<code>[spacex-dash-app.py]</code>

<code>[helper_Plotly.py]</code>

<code>[SpaceY_Plotly_dashboard.jpg]</code>

Build a Plotly Dash application for users to perform interactive visual analytics on SpaceX launch data in
real-time
