# spaceY
## Introduction
In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceY will reuse the first stage.

## Projeects
### Complete and Preprocess the Data Collection API
<code>[jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb]</code>

Make a get request to the SpaceX API. You will also do some basic data wrangling and formating.
* Request to the SpaceX API
* Clean the requested data

### Data Collection with Web Scraping
<code>[jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb]</code>
Perform web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches

### Data Wrangling
<code>[labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb]</code>
Perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.
